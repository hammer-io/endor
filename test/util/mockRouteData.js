/**
 * This class is used to mock route information sent to the controllers.
 *
 * Pass in the details you want the request object to have (such as params,
 * query, etc). Then, wherever the controller has the method signature
 * `doSomething(req, res, next)` you should pass in mock.req, mock.res,
 * and mock.next(). Note the parenthesis on the next method.
 *
 * To assert things against the mock object, you can check the following:
 *
 * mock.wasSent   : true or false, depending on if send() was called
 * mock.wasNexted : true or false, depending on if next() was called
 * mock.sent      : the object passed to send() by the controller
 * mock.nexted    : the object passed to next() by the controller
